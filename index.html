        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m a guy who enjoys doing a lot of things. I've traveled a lot which led to me living in Japan for about four years. While there I picked up the language and a love for trying to make video games! After developing a few mediocre games that people could play in their browser I began to take an interest in developing web apps.</p>
        <p>Now I've returned to the States to finish school and teach myself how to be a better web designer! I'm very excited to expand my skills and see what I can accomplish. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I would like to be able to create web apps of an nature for companies, customers and myself! I have a general idea of the skills I would like to conquer which are:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>C++</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The ultimate goal is to work as a developer who creates websites that makes the end user not have to think. Or if he does think, he thinks "Hmm. What a great website."</p>
